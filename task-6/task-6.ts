// 6. Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each
// character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.


// code:


let personName: string = "\t\n  Daeyan  "
console.log("Name Before Striping => ",personName);
personName = personName.trim();
console.log("Name After Striping => ",personName);
