// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// see that the list has actually been modified.
// code:
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (magician) { return "the Great " + magician; });
}
var magician_names = ["Merlin", "Gandalf", "Houdini", "Dumbledore", "Crime Master GOGO"];
magician_names = make_great(magician_names);
show_magicians(magician_names);
