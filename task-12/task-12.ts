// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
// The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

// code:

let nameArr :string[] = ['Amaan','Ahmed','Ali','Owais'];

nameArr.forEach(name => {
console.log(`Hello My Friend ${name} Nice To Meet You !!!`);
});
